## 1. Brand Voice Foundation

### Who We Sound Like

CrownKinetics speaks with the voice of someone who is:

- **Deeply knowledgeable** about hair science and culturally fluent in Black hair traditions
- **Generous with information** -- we share freely, we do not gatekeep
- **Confident without arrogance** -- we know our products work and we can explain exactly why
- **Warm and relatable** -- like a trusted friend who also happens to have a cosmetic chemistry background
- **Bold when it matters** -- we are not afraid to challenge industry norms that have failed Black hair

### The Voice Triangle

Our voice lives at the intersection of three qualities. Every piece of copy should reflect at least two of these:

```
         SCIENTIFIC
        /          \
       /            \
      /   CrownKin-  \
     /    etics Voice  \
    /                    \
CULTURAL ──────────── EMPOWERING
```

- **Scientific:** We know the chemistry. We cite the research. We explain the ingredients.
- **Cultural:** We speak from within Black hair culture. We honor its history, its rituals, its language.
- **Empowering:** We build confidence. We equip our community with knowledge. We celebrate every texture.

### Voice vs. Tone

**Voice** is constant -- it is who we are. CrownKinetics always sounds knowledgeable, warm, culturally grounded, and empowering.

**Tone** shifts based on context:

| Context | Tone Adjustment |
|---------|----------------|
| Product launch | Excited, confident, celebratory |
| Educational content | Patient, generous, clear |
| Customer complaint | Empathetic, solution-focused, human |
| Social media (casual) | Playful, conversational, community-oriented |
| Serious cultural moment | Respectful, thoughtful, solidarity-driven |
| Sales/promotion | Enthusiastic but never desperate or gimmicky |

## 2. Tone of Voice Examples by Channel

### Product Descriptions (Shopify Store)

**Principle:** Lead with the sensory experience, support with science, close with the practical benefit.

**Example -- CrownKinetics Hydra-Seal Leave-In Conditioner:**

> Your wash day deserves a longer shelf life.
>
> Hydra-Seal Leave-In uses a tri-layer moisture system to keep your curls, coils, and twists hydrated for up to 72 hours. Here is how it works: vegetable glycerin (the humectant layer) draws moisture from the air into your hair shaft. Coconut-derived emollients (the smoothing layer) flatten raised cuticles to reduce tanginess and increase shine. A beeswax-free botanical sealant (the locking layer) creates a lightweight barrier that prevents moisture loss without buildup or flaking.
>
> The result: Day 1 definition that still looks intentional on Day 3.
>
> **Key Ingredients:** Vegetable glycerin, coconut oil fraction, babassu oil, slippery elm extract, marshmallow root
> **Hair Types:** All textures, especially high-porosity 3C-4C
> **Size:** 12 oz / 355 ml

**What makes this work:**
- Opens with a relatable benefit (extending wash day results)
- Explains the science in plain, accessible language
- Avoids jargon without being simplistic
- Names specific hair types
- Lists key ingredients transparently

---

### Social Media

**Instagram (Feed Post):**

> Your hair is not "hard to manage." It is a complex, three-dimensional fiber structure that requires products formulated for its specific porosity, density, and curl pattern -- not reformulated straight-hair products with a "for curls" label.
>
> The problem was never your hair. It was the products.
>
> CrownKinetics formulates from strand one for textured hair. Because your crown deserves more than an afterthought.
>
> #CrownKinetics #TexturedHairScience #YourCrownYourRules

**Instagram (Story / Casual):**

> POV: You just found out your hair has been high-porosity this whole time and that is why nothing was working.
>
> (It is not your hair. It is your routine. Swipe up for our free porosity guide.)

**TikTok / Reels Script (60 seconds):**

> "Let me explain why your deep conditioner is not working, and it has nothing to do with the product.
>
> If you have low-porosity hair, your cuticles are tightly closed. That means product just sits on top of your hair instead of penetrating. You need heat to open those cuticles up.
>
> Here is the move: Apply your deep conditioner, put on a plastic cap, then wrap a warm towel around it. The heat opens the cuticle and lets the conditioning agents actually get inside the hair shaft.
>
> 20 minutes. Rinse with cool water to close the cuticle back down. That is the science. That is the difference.
>
> Try this Saturday and tell me what happens."

### Email Marketing

**Subject Lines (Examples):**

- "The ingredient your 4C curls have been missing"
- "We reformulated. Here is exactly what changed and why."
- "Your scalp is talking. Here is how to listen."
- "Wash day just got 45 minutes shorter"
- "The science behind why your edges are thinning (and how to reverse it)"

**Email Body (Product Launch):**

> Subject: Six months in the lab. One new formula. Zero compromises.
>
> Hi [First Name],
>
> When we launched our Moisture Milk two years ago, you told us two things:
>
> 1. You loved the slip.
> 2. You wanted it without the silicone.
>
> Fair. We heard you. And then we spent six months reformulating.
>
> The new Moisture Milk uses a silicone-free slip system built on broccoli seed oil and hydrolyzed quinoa protein. Same legendary detangling performance. Same 48-hour moisture retention. Zero silicone buildup.
>
> We tested it across 200 community members with hair textures ranging from 3A to 4C. The verdict: 94% said slip was equal to or better than the original. 97% reported no buildup after four weeks of use.
>
> Here is the full ingredient breakdown, the test results, and the reformulation story: [Read More]
>
> Your crown, upgraded.
>
> -- The CrownKinetics Team

### Blog / Educational Content

**Principle:** Teach generously. Position CrownKinetics as the most trustworthy source of textured hair knowledge on the internet.

**Example Opening -- "Porosity 101: The Single Most Important Thing You Can Learn About Your Hair":**

> Forget your hair type number. Seriously. If you only learn one thing about your hair this year, make it your porosity.
>
> Porosity is your hair's ability to absorb and retain moisture. It is determined by the condition of your cuticle -- the outermost layer of each hair strand, made up of overlapping scales (think roof shingles). When those scales are tightly closed, moisture has a hard time getting in. When they are raised or damaged, moisture gets in easily but escapes just as fast.
>
> Understanding this single variable will explain more about your hair's behavior than any curl typing chart ever could. It will tell you why some products work for your friend but not for you. Why your hair dries out by lunchtime. Why your deep conditioner seems to do nothing.
>
> Let us break it down.

---

### Customer Service

**Principle:** Every customer service interaction is a brand moment. We are empathetic, solution-oriented, and never robotic.

**Example -- Responding to a Product Complaint:**

> Hi [Name],
>
> Thank you for reaching out and for being honest about your experience -- that feedback is genuinely valuable to us.
>
> I am sorry that the Curl Defining Cream did not deliver the hold you were looking for. Based on what you have described -- fine, low-porosity 4A hair -- it sounds like the formula may be too heavy for your strand thickness. That is a real thing: products formulated for dense, coarse textures can weigh down finer strands and reduce definition instead of enhancing it.
>
> Here is what I would recommend: our Lightweight Curl Mousse (it is specifically designed for fine-to-medium strands) paired with a small amount of our Hydra-Seal Leave-In applied to soaking wet hair. The mousse gives hold without weight, and the leave-in handles moisture.
>
> I have issued a full refund for the Curl Defining Cream and added a complimentary sample of the Mousse to your account. It will ship with your next order or you can request it separately -- just reply to this email.
>
> Your hair is not the problem. Sometimes it is just about finding the right match.
>
> Warmly,
> [Name], CrownKinetics Support

---

### Packaging Copy

**Principle:** Concise, sensory, and informative. Every word earns its place on the label.

**Front Label:**
> **CrownKinetics**
> Hydra-Seal Leave-In Conditioner
> 72-Hour Moisture Lock | Silicone-Free
> For Curls, Coils & Locs

**Back Label:**
> **How it works:** A tri-layer moisture system that hydrates, smooths, and seals -- no silicones, no sulfates, no buildup. Vegetable glycerin draws moisture in. Coconut-derived emollients smooth the cuticle. Botanical sealants lock everything down.
>
> **How to use:** Apply generously to clean, soaking wet hair. Distribute with fingers or a wide-tooth comb from ends to roots. Style as usual. Do not rinse.
>
> **Formulated for:** All textured hair, especially high-porosity 3C-4C.

## 3. Words to Use and Words to Avoid

### Words and Phrases to Use

These words align with our brand values and resonate with our audience:

**Hair Descriptors:**
- Textured, coily, curly, kinky-coily, tightly coiled
- Natural, protective (as in protective styles)
- Crown (as metaphor)
- Strands, fibers, coils, curls, locs, twists, braids
- Defined, elongated, moisturized, sealed, nourished
- Bouncy, springy, soft, supple, strong, resilient
- Sheen (not shine -- sheen is the natural light reflection of healthy textured hair)

**Scientific/Ingredient Language:**
- Porosity, cuticle, cortex, elasticity, pH-balanced
- Humectant, emollient, sealant, protein-moisture balance
- Formulated, engineered, clinically tested, trichologist-informed
- Ingredient-first, science-backed, research-driven

**Brand/Community Language:**
- Your crown, crown care, crown ritual
- Community, collective, circle, village
- Ritual (not "routine" -- rituals have intention)
- Knowledge, wisdom, education, literacy
- Heritage, legacy, tradition, ancestral
- Celebrate, honor, elevate, empower

**Texture-Positive Language:**
- Shrinkage is not a flaw -- it is a sign of elasticity and health
- Definition, not "control"
- Versatile (hair that can be worn in many ways)
- Unique (not "difficult" or "challenging")

### Words and Phrases to NEVER Use

These words carry negative connotations, reinforce harmful stereotypes, or misrepresent our values:

| Banned Word/Phrase | Why It Is Banned | Use Instead |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Tame** | Implies hair is wild/animalistic | "Define" or "shape" |
| **Unruly** | Implies hair is misbehaving | "Free-form" or "voluminous" |
| **Wild** | Dehumanizing connotation when applied to Black hair | "Bold" or "expressive" |
| **Frizzy** (as negative) | Frizz is natural and neutral; pathologizing it is harmful | "Halo" or describe desired moisture level |
| **Manageable** (as goal) | Implies the default state is unmanageable | "Easy to style" or "responsive" |
| **Good hair** / **Bad hair** | Reinforces colorist and texturist hierarchies | Describe specific texture without value judgment |
| **Exotic** | Othering and fetishizing | "Beautiful" or "stunning" |
| **Tame your mane** | Double offense: "tame" + reducing identity to animal | "Define your crown" |
| **Fix** | Implies something is broken | "Nourish," "strengthen," or "restore" |
| **Problem hair** | Pathologizes natural texture | "Your unique texture" |
| **Coarse** (as negative) | Often used dismissively | "Dense" or "thick-stranded" (neutral descriptors) |
| **Untamed** | Same issue as "tame" | "Natural" or "free" |
| **Normal hair** | Implies textured hair is abnormal | Specify the actual texture being referenced |
| **Ethnic** (as standalone descriptor) | Vague, othering, and outdated | Name the specific community or texture |
| **Urban** (as demographic euphemism) | Coded language with racial connotations | Name the actual community |
| **Nappy** (in brand/marketing copy) | Loaded term; reclamation is personal, not commercial | "Coily" or "tightly textured" |
| **Relaxed** (implying better) | Do not position relaxed/straightened hair as aspirational over natural | Present all styles as equally valid choices |
| **Struggle** / **Battle** (with hair) | War metaphors frame hair care as combat | "Journey," "ritual," "practice" |

### Contextual Exceptions

- **"Kinky"**: May be used in educational content where it is a recognized scientific/trichological texture descriptor (e.g., "kinky-coily textures, classified as Type 4 on the Andre Walker scale"), but never in marketing headlines or product names.
- **"Frizz"**: May be used neutrally (e.g., "frizz is your hair's natural response to humidity") but never as a problem to be eliminated.
- **"Shrinkage"**: May be discussed openly and celebrated as a sign of hair health and elasticity. Never positioned as a negative.

### Social Media Captions (Ready to Use)

**Educational:**
> If your hair feels like straw, you do not need more moisture. You need protein.
>
> Here is the difference: Moisture makes hair soft and pliable. Protein makes hair strong and resilient. You need both, in balance.
>
> If your hair stretches and stretches without snapping back -- that is moisture overload. Your hair needs a protein treatment to rebuild the keratin structure.
>
> If your hair snaps the moment you touch it -- that is protein overload. Your hair needs deep moisture to restore elasticity.
>
> Knowing the difference is everything. Save this post.
>
> #CrownKinetics #ProteinMoistureBalance #TexturedHairScience

**Community Engagement:**
> Saturday morning wash day check-in. Where are you at?
>
> A) Pre-wash oil treatment, feeling patient
> B) Deep conditioner marinating under a heat cap
> C) Twist-out set, air drying, manifesting definition
> D) Done. Admiring the results. Taking 47 selfies.
>
> Drop your letter below.

**Product-Focused:**
> We get asked this a lot: "Why is your leave-in silicone-free?"
>
> Here is the honest answer: Silicones create the illusion of moisture by coating the hair shaft with a smooth, reflective layer. Your hair looks hydrated, but the silicone is actually preventing real moisture from getting in.
>
> Over time, silicone buildup makes hair feel heavy, dull, and progressively drier underneath that glossy coat.
>
> Our Hydra-Seal Leave-In uses broccoli seed oil as a natural alternative. It mimics the slip and shine of silicone without the buildup or the barrier effect. Your hair actually absorbs the moisture instead of wearing it like a raincoat.
>
> Science over shortcuts. Every time.

## 5. Cultural Sensitivity Guidelines

### Core Principle

CrownKinetics exists within Black hair culture, not adjacent to it. Our content must reflect deep cultural knowledge, genuine respect, and a commitment to representation that goes beyond tokenism.

### Guideline 1: We Speak From Within, Not About

- Our brand voice is that of a community member, not an anthropologist.
- We do not explain Black hair culture to an imagined white audience. We speak to our community directly.
- Cultural references should be organic and specific, not performative or over-explained.

**Do:** "Wash day is sacred. We know."
**Do not:** "In Black culture, wash day is a cherished ritual where women gather to..."

### Guideline 2: Credit Cultural Origins

When referencing traditional ingredients, techniques, or practices, acknowledge their cultural roots.

- Shea butter: Acknowledge its West African origins and the women-led cooperatives that produce it.
- Rice water rinses: Credit the practice's roots in Asian hair care traditions (do not appropriate without acknowledgment).
- Protective styling: Recognize its deep history in African and Afro-diasporic culture -- braiding patterns that carried maps to freedom, styles that signified tribal identity, community status, and familial bonds.
- Hot oil treatments: Acknowledge the kitchen-table tradition passed through generations of Black families.

**Do:** "Shea butter has been a cornerstone of West African hair and skin care for centuries. Our shea is sourced from women-led cooperatives in Ghana."
**Do not:** "We discovered the amazing benefits of shea butter!"

### Guideline 3: Never Reduce Culture to Aesthetic

- African prints, headwraps, and cultural garments are not props for product photography.
- If we feature cultural elements, they must be contextually appropriate and styled by someone with cultural knowledge.
- We do not use sacred or ceremonial cultural items (e.g., Maasai beadwork, ceremonial headpieces) as casual marketing props.

### Guideline 4: Navigate the Natural Hair / Relaxed Hair Conversation With Care

- CrownKinetics celebrates ALL choices: natural, relaxed, protective styles, wigs, weaves, locs, braids, silk presses, color, and everything in between.
- We do NOT position natural hair as morally superior to chemically treated hair.
- We do NOT shame women who wear wigs, weaves, or extensions.
- We recognize that the "choice" to go natural exists within a complex web of professional expectations, Eurocentric beauty standards, and personal identity -- and we do not oversimplify it.

**Do:** "Whether you are rocking a twist-out or a 30-inch install, your crown is yours to define."
**Do not:** "Embrace your REAL hair!" (Implies other choices are fake/inauthentic.)

### Guideline 5: Acknowledge the Workplace and Legal Context

- Hair discrimination is real. The CROWN Act (Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair) has been enacted in many states but not all.
- Our content can reference this reality when appropriate, positioning CrownKinetics as an ally in the broader fight for hair freedom.
- We do not exploit this pain for marketing purposes. We acknowledge it, support it, and direct our community to resources.

### Guideline 6: Respect the Diversity Within Blackness

- "Black hair" is not monolithic. It encompasses African American, Afro-Caribbean, Afro-Latina/o, African continental, and mixed-heritage textures and traditions.
- Our content should reflect this breadth -- not default to a single national or cultural perspective.
- Avoid assuming all Black customers are African American. Our community includes Jamaican, Nigerian, Haitian, Brazilian, British, Ethiopian, Somali, Trinidadian, Ghanaian, and countless other identities.

**Do:** Feature diverse cultural perspectives in content. Acknowledge different traditions (e.g., Jamaican castor oil traditions alongside African American kitchen-table practices).
**Do not:** Use "Black hair" as though it refers to a single, unified experience.

### Guideline 7: Engage With Cultural Moments Authentically

| Moment | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| **Black History Month** | Go beyond surface-level celebration. Spotlight specific, lesser-known figures in Black hair history. Avoid commercializing pain. |
| **Juneteenth** | Acknowledge the significance. Do NOT run a "Juneteenth Sale." Donate, educate, or amplify Black voices. |
| **Natural Hair Day (March)** | Celebrate. Share community stories. Feature a wide range of textures and styles. |
| **The CROWN Act milestones** | Share the news, explain the significance, and direct followers to advocacy resources. |
| **Tragedy or injustice** | Respond with care. A brief, sincere statement of solidarity -- not a branded graphic. Silence is also a choice with consequences; find the balance between corporate caution and genuine community membership. |

### Guideline 8: Hire From Within the Culture

- Copywriters, photographers, models, social media managers, and content creators should be people who share the lived experience of the community we serve.
- When external partners or agencies are used, ensure the team includes Black creatives in decision-making roles, not just advisory ones.
- This is not a guideline about optics. It is about quality. Content created from within the culture is better content.

---

## 6. Inclusive Language Standards

### Gender Inclusivity

- CrownKinetics serves all genders. Our default language should be gender-neutral unless specifically addressing a gendered product line or audience segment.
- Use "they/them" as a default singular pronoun when gender is unknown or unspecified.
- Avoid "ladies," "girls," or "queens" as universal audience addresses. Use "community," "you," "your crown."

| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| "Hey ladies!" | "Hey, CrownKinetics community!" or simply "Hey!" |
| "Every woman deserves..." | "Everyone deserves..." or "You deserve..." |
| "She/her" (as universal) | "They/their" or "you/your" |
| "Men's and women's products" | "Products for [hair type/concern]" (when possible) |

**Exception:** Gendered language is appropriate when speaking to a specific persona or in content explicitly targeting a gendered audience (e.g., "CrownKinetics Men" product line, or a campaign specifically celebrating Black women). The key is intentionality, not avoidance.

### Texture and Type Inclusivity

- Never imply a hierarchy among hair textures. 4C is not "harder" or "worse" than 3A.
- Avoid using looser curl patterns as the default or aspirational standard.
- When featuring a single hair type in an image, name it specifically. When speaking generally, reference the full range.
- Do NOT use the Andre Walker hair typing system as the only framework. Supplement it with porosity, density, strand thickness, and elasticity -- which are often more useful for product selection.

### Body and Appearance Inclusivity

- Our models represent a wide range of body types, skin tones, ages, and abilities.
- Avoid language that associates beauty with thinness, youth, or light skin.
- Do not use "flattering" (implies a standard to be flattered against).
- Celebrate beauty as it exists, not as it conforms.

### Ability and Accessibility

- Ensure all digital content meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.
- Use alt text on all images that accurately describes the subject, including hair texture, style, and skin tone where relevant.
- Avoid ableist language: do not use "crazy," "lame," "blind spot," or "falls on deaf ears."
- Consider customers with mobility limitations in product design (e.g., easy-open caps, one-handed pump dispensers).

**Alt Text Example:**
> "A Black woman with deep brown skin and a voluminous 4C afro holds a bottle of CrownKinetics Hydra-Seal Leave-In Conditioner. She is smiling softly and wearing a terracotta-colored linen top. Warm natural light illuminates her from the left, creating a golden glow on her hair."

### Economic Inclusivity

- Do not use language that shames people for their budget or purchasing decisions.
- Avoid "luxury tax" framing that implies our products are only for the affluent.
- Offer content and advice that is useful regardless of what products someone can afford.
- When recommending routines, include options at different price points.

### Religious and Spiritual Sensitivity

- Some of our customers may cover their hair for religious or cultural reasons (e.g., hijab, headwraps). Our products and content should acknowledge and serve them.
- Do not assume all customers display their hair publicly. Under-covering hair care is a valid and important use case.
- When referencing spiritual or religious traditions (e.g., Yoruba, Rastafarian), do so with genuine respect and knowledge, or do not reference them at all.

## 7. Content Review Checklist

Before publishing ANY piece of CrownKinetics content -- whether a social media post, product description, email, blog article, or advertisement -- run it through this checklist:

### Voice and Tone

- [ ] Does this sound like CrownKinetics? (Knowledgeable, warm, culturally grounded, empowering)
- [ ] Is the tone appropriate for the channel and context?
- [ ] Does the copy lead with benefit or story, not feature?
- [ ] Is it free of jargon that our audience would not understand -- or does it explain technical terms clearly?

### Language and Word Choice

- [ ] Does it contain any words from the "Never Use" list?
- [ ] Is the language gender-inclusive (or intentionally gendered for a specific audience)?
- [ ] Is hair texture referenced without hierarchy or value judgment?
- [ ] Are we saying "ritual" instead of "routine" where appropriate?
- [ ] Is "your crown" used naturally, not forced?

### Cultural Sensitivity

- [ ] Does this speak from within the culture, not about it?
- [ ] Are cultural origins credited where relevant?
- [ ] Are cultural items, garments, and symbols used with context and respect?
- [ ] Does it acknowledge the diversity within Blackness (not defaulting to a single national perspective)?
- [ ] If referencing a cultural moment (holiday, event), is the approach genuine and non-commercial?

### Representation

- [ ] Do images feature a diverse range of skin tones, textures, ages, genders, and body types?
- [ ] Has photography been reviewed for digital alteration of hair texture or skin?
- [ ] Are mature Black women and men represented, not just the 20-35 age bracket?
- [ ] Does alt text accurately and respectfully describe the image content?

### Inclusivity

- [ ] Is the content accessible (readable font size, sufficient contrast, alt text)?
- [ ] Is it free of ableist language?
- [ ] Does it avoid economic shaming?
- [ ] Does it celebrate all hair choices (natural, protective, relaxed, wigged, weaved) without hierarchy?

### Accuracy

- [ ] Are all scientific claims accurate and supportable?
- [ ] Are ingredient claims truthful and compliant with FTC guidelines?
- [ ] Have product performance claims been verified (e.g., "72-hour moisture" backed by testing)?
- [ ] Are cultural or historical references accurate?

### Final Gut Check

- [ ] Would I be proud to share this with my most culturally aware, most knowledgeable community member?
- [ ] Does this add value -- does it educate, celebrate, or serve?
- [ ] If this went viral, would it represent CrownKinetics well?
