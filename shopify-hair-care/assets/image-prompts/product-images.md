## Section 1: Flat Lay / Studio Product Shots

### 1A. Single Product -- Front-Facing Hero (Primary PDP Image)

```
A single CrownKinetics product (e.g., an 8oz amber glass bottle with a matte
gold pump cap) centered in the frame against a seamless warm cream (#F5EDE0)
background.

The bottle is positioned at a very slight angle (approximately 5-10 degrees
rotated from dead-center) to add dimension. The gold CrownKinetics label is
clearly legible with the crown emblem, product name, and key ingredients
visible.

Lighting: a large softbox overhead and slightly forward creates even, diffused
illumination. A strip light from the left provides a subtle specular highlight
along the glass edge, revealing the amber color and the product liquid inside.
A white bounce card on the right fills any shadows.

A natural, soft contact shadow grounds the bottle on the surface. No floating
products.

The image is clean, minimal, and luxurious. No props, no distractions. The
product IS the subject.

Shot at 100mm macro equivalent, f/8, for tack-sharp detail from label to cap.
Aspect ratio 1:1. Color-calibrated.

Style reference: Aesop product photography, Drunk Elephant hero shots, Oribe
e-commerce imagery.
```

### 1B. Single Product -- Back Label (Secondary PDP Image)

```
Same product as 1A, rotated 180 degrees to show the back label. The back label
displays: ingredient list, usage instructions, net weight, CrownKinetics URL,
and any certifications (cruelty-free, vegan, Black-owned icons).

Same warm cream background, same lighting setup. The product is centered with
the back label fully legible. Slight angle to avoid direct flash reflection
off the glass.

Shot at 100mm, f/11 for maximum label sharpness. Aspect ratio 1:1.
```

### 1C. Product Group -- Full Line Display (Collection Page Hero)

```
A curated arrangement of 5-7 CrownKinetics products from a single collection
(e.g., the "Moisture Ritual" line) arranged in an asymmetric, editorial grouping
on a surface of natural travertine stone or warm-toned concrete.

Products are arranged by height: tallest bottles in the back-center, shorter
jars and tubes flanking the front. Spacing is intentional -- each product has
breathing room. One product in the front is uncapped with a small amount of
product (a golden oil or a thick cream) visible at the opening or artfully
dripped on the stone surface.

A small sprig of dried lavender and a single shea nut rest near the front-right
as the only props.

Lighting: natural window light from the upper-left. Warm tone. Long, soft
shadows extending to the lower-right add depth and mood. A gold reflector
on the right side provides gentle fill and adds warmth to the shadow side of
the bottles.

Background: the travertine surface fills the bottom two-thirds; the upper third
is a soft, out-of-focus warm cream wall.

Color grading: warm and natural. The amber glass should feel rich and luminous.
Gold caps should gleam without being overexposed.

Shot at 50mm, f/5.6. Aspect ratio 4:3 (landscape). Slight elevation -- camera
is about 25 degrees above the surface, not flat overhead.

Style reference: Le Labo collection shots, Byredo product groupings, Net-a-Porter
beauty editorial.
```

### 1D. Product Pair -- Routine Duo (Cross-Sell Image)

```
Two complementary CrownKinetics products (e.g., a shampoo and conditioner, or
an oil and a cream) placed side by side with a slight overlap or one positioned
just behind the other.

Surface: a sheet of handmade paper in warm cream with visible deckled edges,
laid on top of a dark walnut wood surface. The wood is visible as a border
around the paper.

A thin gold line or ribbon runs diagonally behind the two products, adding
a subtle graphic element.

Lighting: overhead softbox with a warm gel (CTO 1/4), creating uniformly
warm light. Soft shadows.

Shot at 85mm, f/5.6. Aspect ratio 1:1.

Text overlay zone: the upper portion of the frame, above the products, for
"Better Together" or "Complete Your Ritual" messaging.

## Section 2: Lifestyle / In-Use Product Shots

### 2A. Wash Day -- Shampoo Application

```
A Black woman with thick, 4A/4B hair stands in a luxurious, minimally designed
bathroom (warm cream tiles, brass fixtures). She is in the shower or at a basin,
with her hair wet and sectioned. Her hands are working a rich, foamy lather of
CrownKinetics shampoo through one section of her hair.

The CrownKinetics shampoo bottle (amber glass, gold cap) sits on the ledge
beside her, label facing the camera but slightly out of focus. The focus is on
her hands in her hair and the lather.

Expression: eyes closed or looking slightly down, calm and meditative. This is
a ritual, not a chore.

Lighting: soft, diffused overhead bathroom light supplemented by a warm practical
light source (a candle or warm-toned vanity light visible in the background).
Steam or mist in the air adds atmosphere.

Color grading: very warm. The cream tiles, brass fixtures, and amber bottle all
reinforce the brand palette. The lather is white but picks up warm reflections.

Shot at 50mm, f/2.8. Aspect ratio 4:5 (portrait, optimized for mobile).
Water droplets on glass or skin add tactile texture.

Mood: intimate, ritualistic, self-care, serene.

Style reference: Dove Real Beauty campaign intimacy, Susanne Kaufmann spa
imagery, Herbivore Botanicals lifestyle shots.
```

### 2B. Styling -- Curl Cream Application

```
A close-up of a Black woman's hands scooping a generous amount of thick,
buttery curl cream from an open CrownKinetics charcoal matte jar. The cream
is a pale ivory color with visible richness and body.

Her other hand is partially visible, fingers raking through a section of damp,
freshly washed 3C curls. The curls are forming defined spirals where the
product has already been applied.

The jar sits on a bathroom vanity countertop (warm marble or concrete). A small
gold comb and a cream-colored microfiber towel are visible in the soft background.

Lighting: ring light or beauty dish positioned slightly above and forward, creating
even, flattering light on the hands and product. Specular highlight on the cream
in the jar.

Shot at 85mm macro, f/3.5. Extremely sharp focus on the cream texture and the
curl definition. Aspect ratio 1:1.

Mood: tactile, sensory, satisfying. The viewer should almost feel the product.

Style reference: OUAI application shots, Pattern Beauty product-in-use imagery,
Sephora how-to content.
```

### 2C. Oil Treatment -- Scalp Massage

```
A top-down (bird's eye) view of a Black woman lying back, possibly on a treatment
table or a bed with cream linen sheets. Her 4C hair is spread out around her head
in a halo formation, freshly oiled and glistening.

A pair of hands (either her own or a stylist's) are applying golden oil from a
CrownKinetics dropper bottle directly to her scalp along a defined part line. A
thin stream of golden oil is visible mid-drop, catching the light.

Her eyes are closed. Expression is pure relaxation.

Surrounding props on the linen: a small ceramic dish with additional oil, a jade
gua sha tool, and the CrownKinetics oil bottle with its dropper removed.

Lighting: soft, overhead natural light. The oil on her hair and scalp creates
beautiful specular highlights and makes the coils glisten.

Color grading: warm, golden. The linen, the oil, and the skin tones all exist
in a harmonious warm-tone world.

Shot at 35mm, f/4, directly overhead. Aspect ratio 1:1 or 4:5.

Mood: spa-like, luxurious, healing, nourishing.

Style reference: Ceremonia hair oil campaigns, Briogeo scalp care imagery,
Goop beauty content.
```

### 2D. Protective Styling -- Edge Control

```
An extreme close-up of a Black woman's edges (baby hairs along the hairline)
being laid with a small brush. The edges are sleek, smooth, and forming an
elegant swoop pattern along the forehead.

The CrownKinetics edge control product (a small gold-capped jar) is held in
her other hand or sits on a surface nearby. Her nails are manicured in a warm
nude tone.

Her main hairstyle is a sleek bun or updo, partially visible at the top of
the frame. A few small gold hair pins accent the style.

Lighting: beauty dish directly in front for flawless, even skin lighting.
Close-up detail lighting reveals every baby hair and the smooth texture of
the edge control product.

Shot at 100mm macro, f/4. Razor-sharp focus on the edges. Aspect ratio 1:1.

Mood: precision, artistry, finishing touch, confidence.

## Section 3: Before/After Transformation Shots

### 3A. Hydration Transformation -- Full Head

```
A side-by-side diptych on a single canvas:

LEFT ("Before"): A Black woman with 4A/4B hair that appears dry, dull, and
lacking definition. The hair has visible frizz, uneven curl pattern, and a
matte appearance suggesting dehydration. She has a neutral expression. Small
text overlay in the lower corner: "Before CrownKinetics."

RIGHT ("After"): The same woman, same angle, same lighting -- but her hair is
now deeply moisturized, defined, and vibrant. Curls are springy and clumped.
A healthy sheen reflects the light. Volume is maintained but frizz is
dramatically reduced. She has a subtle, confident smile. Small text overlay:
"After 4 weeks."

IMPORTANT: Both images must have IDENTICAL lighting and backgrounds to
ensure the transformation is credible. Background: warm cream. Lighting:
even, diffused studio light. No filters, no tricks.

A thin gold vertical line separates the two halves. The CrownKinetics logo
is subtly watermarked in the bottom center.

Shot at 85mm, f/5.6. Aspect ratio 2:1 (combined diptych) or two separate 1:1
images.

Style reference: Olaplex before/after content, clinical skincare transformation
imagery, Prose hair results.
```

### 3B. Curl Definition Transformation -- Detail Close-Up

```
Two images side by side, tightly cropped on a section of hair (approximately
6-8 inches of curl length):

LEFT: Undefined, frizzy, tangled curls with no visible clumping. Dry texture.
Matte appearance.

RIGHT: The same section of hair with beautifully defined, separated curl clumps.
Each coil is springy and shiny. Product has added visible moisture and hold.

Both shots are macro close-ups at 100mm, f/4, with extremely sharp focus on
individual curls. Background is identical warm cream.

A small CrownKinetics product bottle is positioned between the two images at
the bottom, bridging the transformation.

Aspect ratio 2:1 (combined) or two separate 1:1 squares.

Style reference: DevaCurl transformation shots, science-of-hair clinical imagery.

## Section 4: Bundle/Kit Arrangement Shots

### 4A. Starter Kit -- "The Essentials" (3-Piece Set)

```
Three CrownKinetics products (cleanser, conditioner, leave-in) arranged in a
stepped formation on a warm-toned floating shelf or a minimalist display riser
made of natural wood.

The products are evenly spaced with the tallest in the center and two shorter
products flanking it. A simple kraft gift box with gold foil CrownKinetics
stamping sits open behind them, suggesting the products arrived as a curated set.

Crinkled cream tissue paper spills out of the box organically. A small gold
"CrownKinetics Essentials" card leans against the front product.

Background: solid warm cream wall. Surface: natural light wood.

Lighting: soft, directional from the left. Warm and inviting.

Shot at 50mm, f/4, slight elevation (15 degrees). Aspect ratio 1:1.

Mood: gifting, unboxing, curated luxury, discovery.

Style reference: Glossier set photography, Net-a-Porter beauty box imagery,
FabFitFun unboxing aesthetics.
```

### 4B. Complete Ritual Kit -- "The Full Crown" (6-8 Piece Set)

```
An overhead flat-lay of 6-8 CrownKinetics products arranged in a deliberate
circular or spiral formation on a charcoal (#2B2B2B) linen surface. The
circular arrangement evokes the shape of a crown when viewed from above.

Each product is positioned label-up, clearly identifiable. Small numbered
gold foil stickers (1 through 6/8) are placed next to each product to
indicate the order of the routine.

A printed "ritual guide" card on cream stock with gold text is placed in
the center of the arrangement. The card reads: "Your CrownKinetics Ritual."

Props: a few scattered gold confetti dots and a single dried flower (warm
tone) accent the arrangement without cluttering it.

Lighting: even, overhead softbox. The charcoal linen surface absorbs light
and creates a luxurious dark backdrop that makes the amber and gold packaging
pop.

Shot directly overhead, 35mm, f/8. Aspect ratio 1:1.

Mood: comprehensive, ritual, luxury gifting, investment in self.

Style reference: The Ordinary regimen flat-lays, SK-II routine sets, luxury
advent calendar unboxing shots.
```

### 4C. Travel Kit -- "Crown On-The-Go"

```
A compact travel pouch in deep purple (#3D1F47) vegan leather with a gold
zipper, partially unzipped to reveal 4-5 miniature CrownKinetics products
(2oz versions) nestled inside.

The pouch sits on a warm cream marble surface alongside a boarding pass
(partially visible, warm-toned), a pair of gold-framed sunglasses, and
a passport with a leather cover.

Two of the mini products are pulled out of the pouch and placed next to it,
labels facing up.

Lighting: bright and clean, natural window light from behind-right. Light,
airy mood.

Shot at 50mm, f/4. Aspect ratio 4:5 (portrait for mobile/social).

Mood: jet-set, effortless luxury, prepared, chic.

Style reference: Away luggage lifestyle shots, Tumi travel accessories,
Net-a-Porter travel edits.

## Section 5: Texture Detail Shots

### 5A. Cream/Butter Texture -- Swatch

```
A thick, generous swatch of CrownKinetics curl cream or hair butter spread
on a smooth, warm-toned surface (travertine stone, warm concrete, or skin).
The swatch is approximately 3 inches in diameter with a natural, slightly
uneven spread that shows the richness and body of the product.

The texture is clearly visible: thick, buttery, with slight peaks and valleys
from the application. The color is a rich, pale ivory with subtle golden
undertones.

One edge of the open product jar is visible in the upper corner of the frame
for context.

Lighting: raking light from the side (approximately 30 degrees above the
surface) to accentuate the three-dimensional texture of the swatch. Every
ridge and swirl catches a highlight.

Shot at 100mm macro, f/5.6. Extremely close. The swatch fills 60-70% of
the frame. Aspect ratio 1:1.

Mood: tactile, rich, sensory, quality.

Style reference: skincare texture swatches (Glossier, Drunk Elephant),
paint swatch close-ups, food photography butter textures.
```

### 5B. Oil Texture -- Drop/Pour

```
A single drop of golden CrownKinetics hair oil captured mid-fall from the
glass dropper, with a thin stream connecting the dropper to a small golden
pool on a warm cream ceramic dish below.

The oil is perfectly translucent and golden -- like liquid amber. Light
refracts through the drop, creating a tiny lens effect.

The dropper bottle is partially visible at the top of the frame, held by
a hand with warm brown skin and clean, natural nails.

Lighting: strong backlight to illuminate the oil and make it glow. The
drop itself becomes a jewel of golden light. Fill from the front keeps
the hand and bottle visible.

Shot at 100mm macro, f/2.8, with focus locked on the falling drop (may
require high-speed capture or compositing). Aspect ratio 1:1 or 4:5.

Mood: precious, pure, liquid gold, indulgent.

Style reference: serum drop photography (La Mer, SkinCeuticals), olive
oil pour shots, perfume ingredient close-ups.
```

### 5C. Gel/Custard Texture -- Finger Stretch

```
A close-up of two fingers (thumb and index) pulling apart a clear, golden-
tinted gel or custard product, creating a stretchy, viscous thread between
them. The stretch demonstrates the product's slip, hold, and consistency.

The background is solid warm cream, out of focus. The gel catches the light
beautifully, appearing almost jewel-like as it thins between the fingers.

Lighting: backlit with a warm-toned light to make the gel translucent and
luminous. Front fill keeps the fingers well-lit.

Shot at 100mm macro, f/3.5. The stretching gel thread is the focal point.
Aspect ratio 1:1.

Mood: satisfying, tactile, quality, performance.

Style reference: slime/gel ASMR close-ups elevated to luxury, hair gel
texture shots, cosmetic texture testing imagery.

## Post-Production Standards

1. **Color calibration:** All product shots must be color-calibrated using an X-Rite ColorChecker or equivalent. Packaging colors must match physical products within Delta E < 3.
2. **Retouching:** Remove dust, scratches, and fingerprints from packaging. Do not alter product color, label design, or proportions.
3. **Background consistency:** All products within the same collection must use identical backgrounds for visual cohesion across the storefront.
4. **Shadow treatment:** Contact shadows should be natural and soft. For isolated product shots (transparent PNG), add a subtle programmatic drop shadow via CSS rather than baking it into the image.
5. **Naming convention:** `[product-slug]_[shot-type]_[number].[format]` -- Example: `moisture-ritual-shampoo_hero_01.webp`
