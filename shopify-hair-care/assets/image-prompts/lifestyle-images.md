## Section 1: Women with Different Hair Types

### 1A. Type 3A -- Loose Curls

```
A portrait of a Black woman in her mid-30s with long, loose 3A curls that fall
past her shoulders. Her curls are large, well-defined S-shaped spirals with a
glossy, healthy sheen. Hair color is a natural dark brown with subtle warm
highlights that catch the light.

She sits in a sunlit window seat in a minimal, warm-toned interior (cream walls,
linen curtains, natural wood furniture). She is reading a hardcover book, one hand
in her hair, casually twirling a curl around her finger. Her expression is relaxed
and absorbed in the moment.

She wears a cream cashmere sweater. Natural, minimal makeup.

Lighting: soft, directional window light from the right. The sun creates a warm
glow on the side of her face and illuminates the translucent edges of her curls.
A gentle fill from the room's ambient light preserves detail in the shadows.

Color grading: warm, golden midtones. Soft highlights. Rich but not oversaturated.

Shot at 85mm, f/2.5, with the background (bookshelf, window frame) softly blurred.
Aspect ratio 4:5 (portrait). Focus on her face and the curls framing it.

Mood: intellectual, cozy, effortless beauty, "the curl is perfect without trying."

magazine covers.
```

### 1B. Type 3B -- Springy Ringlets

```
A full-body environmental portrait of a Black woman in her late 20s with voluminous
3B ringlets. Her hair is big -- truly voluminous -- cascading around her face and
shoulders like a mane. Each ringlet is defined, bouncy, and springy.

Setting: an urban rooftop or terrace at golden hour. The city skyline is visible
but soft in the background. She stands near the edge, leaning on a railing, looking
over her shoulder at the camera with a playful, confident expression.

She wears a structured, earth-toned blazer over a simple cream top and gold hoop
earrings. The wind gently lifts some of her curls, creating dynamic movement.

Lighting: golden hour backlight from behind-left. Her hair is partially
silhouetted, with individual ringlets lit up like golden coils. A warm reflector
from camera-right provides fill on her face.

Color grading: warm amber tones dominate. The cityscape is desaturated slightly
to ensure she remains the focal point. Her skin has a warm, radiant glow.

Shot at 70mm, f/2.8. Aspect ratio 3:4. She occupies the right two-thirds of
the frame; the skyline fills the left third.

Mood: urban goddess, confident, dynamic, golden hour magic.

photography, Vogue September issue covers.
```

### 1C. Type 3C -- Tight Curls / Corkscrew Coils

```
A beauty-focused close-up portrait of a Black woman with 3C corkscrew curls
cropped to chin-length. Her curls are tightly coiled, densely packed, and
incredibly defined -- each coil catches light individually.

The frame is tight: from mid-forehead to just below the chin. Her hand reaches
up from the bottom-left corner of the frame, gently stretching one curl to
demonstrate its spring and elasticity. The stretched curl is approximately
5 inches long; when released, it bounces back to 2 inches.

Her expression is a knowing half-smile. Direct eye contact.

Background: solid deep purple (#3D1F47), slightly lighter in the center
(vignette in reverse -- the center is subtly brighter).

Lighting: beauty dish directly in front and slightly above for perfect,
even illumination. A small hair light from behind adds rim separation and
makes individual coils pop against the dark background.

Color grading: rich, saturated. Her skin is warm bronze with golden highlights.
The deep purple background and the brown/auburn of her curls create a regal
color harmony.

Shot at 100mm, f/3.5. Razor-sharp focus on the eyes and the coils nearest
the camera. Aspect ratio 1:1.

Mood: defined, powerful, texture-obsessed, beauty editorial.

Style reference: Pat McGrath beauty campaigns, Fenty Beauty close-ups,
Harper's Bazaar beauty editorials.
```

### 1D. Type 4A -- Coily S-Pattern

```
A lifestyle portrait of a Black woman in her early 40s with 4A coils styled
in a pineapple updo -- her coils gathered loosely at the crown of her head
and fanning outward. A few coils escape and frame her forehead and temples.

She is in a bright, sun-filled kitchen, pouring coffee from a French press
into a cream-colored ceramic mug. The kitchen is modern and warm: butcher
block countertops, open shelving with minimal ceramics, a small herb plant
in a terracotta pot.

She wears a silk robe in deep purple (#3D1F47) over a cream tank top. Her
morning routine is unhurried and luxurious.

Lighting: bright morning window light from a large window in front of her.
Backlighting from a secondary window behind her creates a soft rim light
on her hair and robe.

Color grading: bright and warm but not blown out. The morning light is
golden. The deep purple robe is a rich accent against the cream/wood kitchen.

Shot at 50mm, f/2.8. She is in the left half of the frame; the kitchen
environment fills the right half. Aspect ratio 16:9 (landscape, for
homepage "About" section or blog feature).

Mood: elevated morning routine, mature confidence, lived-in luxury.

Style reference: Joanna Gaines lifestyle imagery (translated to Afrocentric
context), West Elm catalog photography, Apartment Therapy features.
```

### 1E. Type 4B -- Z-Pattern Coils

```
A striking fashion-editorial portrait of a Black woman with 4B z-pattern
coils worn in a large, rounded afro that is meticulously shaped and
voluminous. Her afro is at least 8-10 inches in diameter, perfectly
symmetrical, and dense with tight, angular coils.

She sits on a simple charcoal linen-upholstered mid-century modern chair
against a warm cream background. She wears an architectural, cream-colored
sculptural top that echoes the geometry of her afro. Large gold geometric
earrings frame her jawline.

Her posture is upright and regal. Expression is serene and direct.
She commands the frame.

Lighting: classic Rembrandt lighting -- key light from upper-left creating
a defined triangle of light on the shadow side of her face. The afro is
lit from both sides with strip lights to reveal its density and the z-pattern
texture.

Color grading: warm but contrasty. The cream background, cream top, and warm
skin tones form a tonal harmony. The gold earrings and the subtle warm
undertones in her afro are the warmest accents.

Shot at 85mm, f/4. Aspect ratio 4:5. She is centered with her afro nearly
touching the top edge of the frame.

Mood: sculptural, regal, Afrocentric power, fashion-meets-fine-art.

Style reference: Kwame Brathwaite photography, Tyler Mitchell editorials,
Zanele Muholi portraits (in commercial adaptation).
```

### 1F. Type 4C -- Tight Coils / Maximum Shrinkage

```
A joyful, movement-filled portrait of a Black woman in her mid-20s with 4C
hair in its fully shrunk state -- a compact, dense, beautifully shaped TWA
or short afro of approximately 3-4 inches when stretched but appearing as
1.5-2 inches due to shrinkage.

She is captured mid-laugh, head thrown back slightly, eyes crinkled with
genuine joy. One hand touches the side of her head, fingers grazing her
hair. Her nails are painted in antique gold.

Setting: outdoors in a flower garden or against a warm terracotta wall.
Golden hour light.

She wears a simple white off-shoulder top. A thin gold chain with the
CrownKinetics crown pendant rests at her collarbone.

Lighting: golden hour light from behind and left. Her short afro is backlit,
creating a luminous halo effect where individual coils are outlined in gold.
A warm reflector provides fill on her face.

Color grading: warm, joyful, sun-kissed. Her skin glows. The terracotta or
floral background provides rich, warm complementary tones.

Shot at 85mm, f/2.0. Aspect ratio 1:1. Her face and hair fill the center
60% of the frame.

Mood: radiant joy, shrinkage is beautiful, freedom, confidence.

IMPORTANT ART DIRECTION NOTE: 4C hair is often underrepresented or shown
only in stretched styles. This image celebrates 4C texture in its natural,
fully shrunk state. The hair should look moisturized, healthy, and cared for
-- but it should NOT be stretched, elongated, or styled to appear longer
than it naturally is.

## Section 2: Men's Grooming Shots

### 2A. The Fresh Lineup -- Barbershop Precision

```
A portrait of a Black man in his late 20s with a precision-cut high-top fade.
The sides are tapered to skin with a crisp lineup at the hairline, temples,
and neckline. The top has 1-2 inches of dense, moisturized 4A/4B coils that
are well-defined and subtly glistening from product.

He faces the camera at a three-quarter angle, one hand resting on his jawline.
His beard is neatly groomed -- not long, but present and shaped. Expression
is calm, assured, direct.

Setting: a warm, minimally designed grooming space -- think dark wood surfaces,
a round mirror with a brass frame slightly out of focus behind him, warm
lighting.

He wears a simple black crew-neck tee. A thin gold chain is visible at his
neckline.

Lighting: warm, directional. Key light from the left at 45 degrees. A warm
practical light (a brass sconce or barbershop-style globe bulb) visible in
the background. The lighting makes his skin rich and warm and highlights the
texture contrast between the tapered sides and the coily top.

Color grading: warm and rich. Deep skin tones, warm blacks in the tee, amber
and gold accents in the environment. Slight film-grain texture.

Shot at 85mm, f/2.8. Aspect ratio 4:5.

Mood: masculine luxury, precision, quiet confidence, "the details matter."

Style reference: Bevel campaign imagery, GQ grooming features, Frederick
Douglass barbershop portraiture (contemporary adaptation).
```

### 2B. Loc'd and Elevated -- Locs / Dreadlocks

```
A full-length editorial portrait of a Black man in his mid-30s with shoulder-
length, well-maintained locs. His locs are medium-width, uniform, and show
the natural texture progression from root to tip. They are pulled back loosely
in a half-up style, with several locs framing his face.

Setting: a creative studio or loft space with exposed brick (warm-toned),
large industrial windows, and minimal furniture. He stands near a window,
leaning against the brick wall with a relaxed, contemplative posture.

He wears a structured overcoat in charcoal over a cream turtleneck. One hand
holds a small amber glass CrownKinetics loc oil bottle casually at his side.

Lighting: dramatic natural light from the window. Strong directional light
creates contrast between the lit side of his face/locs and the shadowed side.
The locs nearest the window are illuminated, showing their color variation
and healthy sheen.

Color grading: warm and slightly desaturated. The brick, skin tones, and
amber bottle are the warmest elements. Shadows lean toward charcoal, not black.

Shot at 50mm, f/2.5. Aspect ratio 3:4.

Mood: creative professional, elevated street style, intentional grooming.

Style reference: Mr. Porter editorial, A$AP Rocky fashion features, Kinfolk
Magazine male portraits.
```

### 2C. Beard & Body -- Full Grooming Ritual

```
A medium shot of a Black man in his early 30s, shirtless, standing at a
bathroom vanity applying CrownKinetics beard oil. He holds the glass dropper
in one hand, applying oil to his full, well-groomed beard with the other.
His chest and shoulders are visible, skin moisturized and healthy.

His hair is a short, natural 4B texture -- not styled, just clean and moisturized.

The bathroom is minimal and warm: white subway tile with warm grout, a
wooden shelf with neatly arranged CrownKinetics products (beard oil, hair
cream, body oil), a round mirror with a thin gold frame.

His expression is focused -- looking at himself in the mirror (the camera
is positioned where the mirror would be, as if the viewer IS the mirror).

Lighting: warm overhead vanity light supplemented by natural window light
from the side. Soft, flattering, with enough dimension to show muscle
definition without being overtly fitness-focused.

Color grading: warm, intimate. The bathroom's white and wood tones are warm.
His skin has a natural, warm glow.

Shot at 35mm, f/2.8. Aspect ratio 4:5.

Mood: morning ritual, masculine self-care, unhurried, private moment.

## Section 3: Kids with Natural Hair

### 3A. Wash Day Fun

```
A bright, warm lifestyle shot of a Black mother and her daughter (approximately
5-6 years old) during bath time or wash day. The daughter sits on a bathroom
counter or in a bathtub while her mother gently detangles her thick, 4A coils
with a wide-tooth comb and conditioner.

The little girl has a big, joyful smile -- maybe giggling or making a silly face.
Her hair is wet, sectioned, and full of white conditioner. One section is already
detangled and showing defined coils; the rest is still being worked on.

The mother looks at her daughter with warmth and patience. She holds a section of
hair gently in one hand and the comb in the other. A CrownKinetics kids' product
(bright, fun packaging with the crown emblem) sits on the counter.

Bathroom setting: bright, clean, warm cream tiles. Colorful bath toys visible.
A cream towel with a subtle gold crown embroidery hangs nearby.

Lighting: bright, even, cheerful. Overhead bathroom light supplemented by
a soft fill to eliminate harsh shadows. The mood is sunny and positive.

Color grading: bright and warm. Slightly lifted shadows for a cheerful, airy feel.
The warm cream of the bathroom and the golden tones in their skin create harmony.

Shot at 35mm, f/3.5. Aspect ratio 4:5.

Mood: bonding, joy, generational hair care, teaching moment, natural hair is
loved from the start.

### 3B. School Day Styling

```
A morning-routine lifestyle image of a Black father styling his young daughter's
hair (approximately 7-8 years old). She sits on a stool in a kitchen or living
room while he stands behind her, carefully creating two-strand twists or cornrows.

His hands are skilled and gentle. He has a wide-tooth comb tucked behind his ear
or in his back pocket. Several hair clips hold sections of her hair. A
CrownKinetics kids' detangler spray and styling cream sit on the counter beside
them.

The little girl watches a tablet propped in front of her (screen not visible to
camera), content and comfortable. She wears a school uniform or simple outfit.

The father wears a simple henley shirt and has a short, well-groomed haircut.
His expression is focused and caring.

Setting: a warm, well-lit kitchen with morning light streaming through a window.
Coffee cup visible. The scene is lived-in, authentic, warm.

Lighting: natural morning window light from the side. Warm and bright.

Shot at 50mm, f/2.8. Aspect ratio 16:9 (landscape, for blog or homepage feature).

Mood: tender masculinity, everyday ritual, "dads do hair too," normalizing
Black father involvement, morning warmth.

Style reference: Dove Men+Care campaigns, This Is Us TV show warmth, editorial
father-daughter portraiture.
```

### 3C. Natural Hair Celebration -- Group of Kids

```
A group shot of 4-5 Black children (ages 4-10, mixed genders) standing side by
side against a warm cream background, each with a different natural hairstyle:
afro puffs, cornrows, twist-out, short fro, and braids with beads.

They look directly at the camera with big, genuine smiles and confident postures.
Some have hands on hips, some have their hands in each other's hair, some are
mid-laugh. The energy is playful and celebratory.

They wear simple, coordinating outfits in warm neutrals -- cream, tan, soft
brown -- so their hair remains the focus.

Lighting: bright, even studio light from a large softbox. Cheerful and clean.
No dramatic shadows.

Color grading: warm, bright, slightly lifted. Their skin tones range across
the spectrum and are beautifully lit.

Shot at 35mm, f/5.6 for even sharpness across the group. Aspect ratio 16:9.

Above the group (in the negative space): potential text overlay reading
"Little Crowns" (CrownKinetics kids' line name).

Mood: celebration, pride, joy, diversity of texture, next generation.

## Section 4: Hair Care Routine Step-by-Step Visuals

### 4A. Complete Wash Day Ritual -- 6-Step Sequence

A series of 6 images shot in the same warm, minimal bathroom setting with the
same model (a Black woman with 4A/4B hair). All images share identical lighting,
color grading, and aspect ratio (1:1 square) for visual consistency when
displayed as a grid or carousel.

#### Step 1: Pre-Poo / Oil Treatment
```
The model sections her dry hair into 4 quadrants, held with large clips.
She applies golden oil from a CrownKinetics dropper bottle to her scalp
along the part lines. Her hair is dry and in its natural, slightly
shrunken state. A warm cream towel is draped over her shoulders.

Focus: her hands applying oil, the dropper, the sectioned hair.
A small "Step 1" numeral in gold appears in the corner.
```

#### Step 2: Cleansing / Shampoo
```
The model is in the shower. Her hair is thoroughly wet and she is working
a rich, creamy lather through one section of her hair with both hands.
The CrownKinetics shampoo bottle sits on a cream-toned shower ledge.
Suds cascade down the section, and her eyes are closed in relaxation.

Focus: the lather, her hands in her hair, the wet curl pattern visible
beneath the suds. "Step 2" in gold in the corner.
```

#### Step 3: Deep Conditioning
```
The model sits on the edge of a bathtub or a stool with a deep purple
(#3D1F47) satin-lined processing cap on her head. The CrownKinetics
deep conditioner jar is open on the counter, a generous scoop of product
visible. She is wrapped in a cream towel, scrolling her phone, relaxed.
A warm steam or mist effect suggests the cap is trapping heat.

Focus: the processing cap (branded with crown emblem), the open product
jar, her relaxed state. "Step 3" in gold.
```

#### Step 4: Detangling
```
The model sits at a vanity, hair wet and conditioner-saturated, working
through sections with a wide-tooth wooden comb. One section is fully
detangled and hanging in defined, wet coils. Other sections are still
clipped up. She uses a CrownKinetics leave-in conditioner as a
detangling aid -- the bottle is in her other hand.

Focus: the comb moving through the hair, the defined wet coils of the
completed section, the contrast between detangled and un-detangled.
"Step 4" in gold.
```

#### Step 5: Styling / Product Application
```
The model stands in front of a mirror, applying CrownKinetics curl cream
using the "praying hands" technique -- both palms pressed together with
product between them, then smoothing down a section of hair. Her hair
is wet but no longer dripping. Defined curl clumps are forming where
product has been applied.

Focus: her hands smoothing product through hair, the curl clumps forming,
the styling cream jar on the counter. "Step 5" in gold.
```

#### Step 6: Final Result / Styled
```
The model, now fully styled with beautifully defined, bouncy curls/coils,
stands in the same bathroom but has changed into a stylish outfit (cream
blouse, gold earrings). She admires her completed hair in the mirror with
a satisfied, confident expression. Her hair is dry (or nearly dry), defined,
voluminous, and glossy.

All CrownKinetics products used in the routine are arranged neatly on the
counter beside her, creating a product lineup shot integrated into the
lifestyle scene.

Focus: the final hair result, her confidence, the product lineup. "Step 6"
in gold.
```

---

## Section 5: Community / Group Shots Celebrating Natural Hair

### 5A. The Gathering -- Three Generations

```
A warm, intimate group portrait of three Black women from three generations:
a grandmother (60s+), a mother (30s-40s), and a daughter (teens or early 20s).

The grandmother has silver-white hair styled in elegant locs or a cropped
silver afro. The mother has shoulder-length, defined 3C curls with warm
brown color. The daughter has long, thick 4A coils styled in a fresh
twist-out.

They sit together on a warm, linen-upholstered sofa in a sun-filled living
room. The grandmother is in the center, the other two flanking her. They
lean into each other naturally -- the mother's head rests near the
grandmother's shoulder; the daughter's hand rests on the grandmother's knee.

They are laughing together, caught mid-conversation. The warmth between them
is palpable and genuine.

Styling: each wears a different warm-toned outfit that reflects her
generation's style while maintaining color harmony (cream, gold, earth tones,
deep purple accents).

Lighting: abundant natural window light from the side, filling the room with
warmth. The living room decor includes Afrocentric art on the walls and
warm-toned textiles.

Color grading: warm, golden, intimate. Highlights are creamy. Shadows are
gentle.

Shot at 35mm, f/2.8. Aspect ratio 16:9.

Mood: legacy, generational wisdom, family bonds, "our crowns are inherited."

Style reference: Oprah Magazine family features, Annie Leibovitz group
portraits (warmth and intimacy), Johnson Publishing historical portraiture
(contemporary adaptation).
```

### 5B. The Collective -- Friends Celebrating

```
A dynamic group shot of 5-6 Black women in their 20s-30s, each with a
distinctly different natural hairstyle (locs, afro, braids, twist-out,
silk press, bantu knots). They stand in a loose, organic cluster on an
urban sidewalk or in front of a warm-toned mural wall.

The energy is celebratory and communal. Some are hugging, some are
throwing their hands up, one is adjusting another's hair affectionately.
Genuine laughter and joy. This is a group of friends who love each
other and each other's hair.

Styling: eclectic but cohesive within the warm palette. Earth tones,
golds, creams, with pops of deep purple. The styling is elevated street
style -- not formal, but intentional.

Lighting: golden hour natural light. Warm, directional, with long
shadows on the ground. Some lens flare is welcome.

Color grading: warm, vibrant, joyful. Skin tones pop. The mural or
urban environment provides colorful but secondary visual interest.

Shot at 35mm, f/4. Aspect ratio 4:5 (portrait, for social media).

Mood: sisterhood, celebration, diversity of beauty, Black joy, community.

Style reference: Essence Festival photography, Afropunk style
documentation, Girlfriends TV show promotional imagery.
```

### 5C. Natural Hair Meetup -- Workshop/Event

```
A candid documentary-style wide shot of a natural hair care workshop or
community event hosted by CrownKinetics. A group of 10-15 Black women
of various ages sit in a bright, airy event space.

In the foreground, one woman demonstrates a styling technique on another
seated woman's hair. Others watch, some take notes, some photograph with
their phones. CrownKinetics products are arranged on a table nearby with
branded signage.

The event space is styled warmly: folding chairs with cream linen covers,
a CrownKinetics banner (deep purple with gold logo) on the back wall,
small floral arrangements with dried botanicals on surfaces.

Lighting: bright, natural light from large windows supplemented by warm
event lighting. The space feels inviting and alive.

Color grading: warm, editorial-documentary. Slightly desaturated to feel
authentic and candid rather than overly polished. Warm tones maintained.

Shot at 24mm, f/4. Aspect ratio 16:9. Wide angle captures the full scene
and the communal energy.

Mood: knowledge-sharing, community, empowerment, brand-as-facilitator.

## Section 6: Behind-the-Scenes / Brand Story Images

### 6A. The Founder's Story

```
An intimate portrait of a Black woman (the fictional CrownKinetics founder)
in her late 30s, standing in a small, beautiful product development lab or
kitchen workspace. She holds an amber glass bottle up to the light, examining
the clarity of a golden oil formulation she has just created.

The workspace is warm and artisanal: wooden shelves lined with raw ingredients
in glass jars (shea butter, coconut oil, dried herbs), a marble mortar and
pestle, notebooks with handwritten formulas, small beakers and measuring tools.

She wears a simple white lab apron over a cream blouse. Her own natural hair
(4B coils) is styled in a high puff. A pair of reading glasses sits on her
head. She is the embodiment of "scientist meets artist."

Lighting: warm, intimate. A single pendant light above the workspace casts a
pool of warm light on the table and her hands. Natural light from a small
window provides fill. The periphery of the space falls into warm shadow.

Color grading: warm, intimate, slightly moody. The amber bottles, wooden shelves,
and golden ingredients create a cohesive warm palette. Her skin glows in the
warm light.

Shot at 50mm, f/2.5. Aspect ratio 4:5.

Mood: passion, craftsmanship, origin story, "every formula has a story."

Style reference: Aesop brand story photography, Dr. Barbara Sturm lab imagery,
Patagonia founder stories.
```

### 6B. Ingredient Sourcing -- Field to Formula

```
A documentary-style landscape photograph of a shea tree in a West African
landscape (Ghana, Burkina Faso, Nigeria). The tree stands alone in a golden
savanna at late afternoon, its broad canopy creating dappled shade.

In the mid-ground, a group of West African women (2-3) gather shea nuts
from the ground, wearing colorful traditional wraps. The scene is respectful
and non-exploitative -- these women are skilled, dignified workers, not props.

The foreground features a close-up element: a basket or calabash filled with
freshly gathered shea nuts, creating depth and connecting the viewer to the
tactile reality of the ingredients.

Lighting: late afternoon sun. Golden, warm, directional. Long shadows across
the savanna.

Color grading: warm, earthy. The golden grass, the rich browns of the shea
nuts, the warm skin tones, and the blue sky (muted and leaning warm) create
a landscape of natural abundance.

Shot at 35mm, f/5.6. Aspect ratio 16:9. Landscape orientation for a homepage
"Our Story" section banner.

Mood: sourcing integrity, connection to the earth, African heritage,
transparency, respect.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If AI-generated, this image must be created with extreme
care to avoid stereotypical or reductive depictions of African people and
landscapes. Consult with cultural advisors. Ideally, commission real
documentary photography from a West African photographer.

### 6C. Product Development -- Lab / Formulation

```
An overhead flat-lay of a product development workspace in progress. On a
white marble surface:

- A notebook with handwritten formulation notes and sketches of molecular
  structures (visible but not fully legible -- it suggests science, not
  classroom)
- Several small glass beakers containing liquids in varying shades of gold,
  amber, and clear
- A digital pH meter laying across the notebook
- Raw ingredients in small ceramic dishes: shea butter (pale ivory), raw
  honey (golden), activated charcoal (jet black), dried hibiscus petals
  (deep crimson)
- A single finished CrownKinetics product bottle in the corner, showing
  the journey from raw ingredients to final product
- A pair of latex-free nitrile gloves draped casually beside the beakers
- A small potted rosemary plant in a terracotta pot

The arrangement is intentional but not overly styled -- it should feel like
an active workspace that someone just stepped away from.

Lighting: bright, even overhead light. Clean and scientific but warm (not
cold fluorescent). The marble surface adds subtle warmth and luxury.

Color grading: bright, clean, warm. The raw ingredients provide the color
accents against the neutral marble and glass.

Shot directly overhead, 35mm, f/8. Aspect ratio 1:1.

Mood: science meets nature, formulation craft, transparency, innovation.

### 6D. Warehouse / Fulfillment -- Ready to Ship

```
A medium-wide shot of a small, organized e-commerce fulfillment space. Shelves
of CrownKinetics products in their packaging line the back wall. A packing
station in the foreground shows a half-packed order: a kraft shipping box
(CrownKinetics branded) sits open with cream tissue paper, products being
arranged inside, and a printed thank-you card ready to be placed on top.

A team member (a Black woman in a CrownKinetics-branded cream tee) is
carefully placing a product into the box with both hands, focused and
attentive to the presentation.

The space is clean, warm, well-lit, and organized. It feels small and
intentional -- this is not a massive warehouse; this is a brand that
personally packs every order.

Lighting: bright overhead warehouse-style lighting supplemented by natural
light from a side window. Warm and bright.

Color grading: warm, authentic, slightly lifted. The kraft boxes, cream
tissue, and amber products create the brand palette naturally.

Shot at 28mm, f/4. Aspect ratio 16:9.

Mood: care, attention to detail, small-business pride, every order matters.

## Section 7: Editorial / Campaign Concept Shoots

### 7A. "Crown Frequency" -- Motion and Energy

```
A high-fashion editorial concept: a Black woman with a massive 4C afro is
captured mid-movement -- spinning, head-turning, or shaking her hair. Motion
blur on the afro tips conveys kinetic energy (the "Kinetics" in CrownKinetics)
while her face and center of her hair remain sharp.

She wears a minimal, sculptural gold garment or draping. The background is
solid charcoal. Gold metallic confetti or gold dust particles are frozen
mid-air around her, caught by the hair light.

Lighting: dramatic. A beauty dish for her face, two strip lights flanking
for rim separation, and a hair light above and behind for the golden halo
effect. The gold confetti catches the light from multiple angles.

Shot at 1/30 second shutter speed (slow enough for motion blur) with flash
to freeze the confetti. 85mm, f/2.8.

Color grading: high contrast. Rich blacks, hot gold highlights, warm skin.

Aspect ratio 2:3 (vertical, full-page editorial).

Mood: kinetic energy, power, celebration, high fashion meets natural hair.

Style reference: Nick Knight fashion photography, Solve Sundsbo beauty
campaigns, Vogue Italia Black issue covers.
```

### 7B. "Quiet Crown" -- Stillness and Ritual

```
A contemplative, intimate editorial: a Black woman sits in an empty room on
the floor, legs crossed, in a meditative pose. Her hair (long, thick 4A
twists) is draped over one shoulder, and she holds a CrownKinetics oil
bottle in her cupped palms like a precious object.

The room is minimal: raw plaster walls in warm cream, bare hardwood floors,
a single shaft of warm light entering through a window at the left. Nothing
else in the room.

She wears a simple, flowing cream linen dress. Bare feet. No jewelry
except a thin gold band on one finger.

Lighting: chiaroscuro. The single window light creates a dramatic light-to-
shadow ratio. Her face is half-lit. The oil bottle glows where the light
hits the amber glass.

Color grading: muted, warm, painterly. The image feels like a Vermeer
painting -- quiet light, rich shadows, warm tones, intimate scale.

Shot at 50mm, f/2.0. Aspect ratio 3:4.

Mood: ritual, stillness, reverence, self-care as sacred practice.

Style reference: Vermeer painting light, Rineke Dijkstra portraiture
simplicity, Dior J'adore quiet moments.
