## Section 1: Logo Generation Prompts

### 1A. Primary Logo -- Full Wordmark + Crown Emblem

```
A luxury brand logo for "CrownKinetics" -- an ethnic hair care company. The logo
combines a custom wordmark with an integrated crown symbol.

THE WORDMARK:
"Crown" is set in a refined, high-contrast serif typeface with elegant thick-thin
stroke variation. The capital "C" has a graceful, sweeping bowl. The letters are
spaced with generous tracking for a premium feel. "Kinetics" sits directly below
or beside "Crown" in a lighter-weight geometric sans-serif, letterspaced widely
to match the width of "Crown." The contrast between the ornate serif and the
clean sans-serif creates visual tension that communicates heritage meeting science.

THE CROWN EMBLEM:
Above the "o" in "Crown" (or integrated into the wordmark), a minimal, abstracted
crown motif. The crown is NOT a traditional European crown -- it is inspired by
African royal headpieces: think Yoruba ade crowns, Egyptian pschent crowns, or
Zulu isicolo forms. The design is geometric and minimal: 3-5 triangular or
pointed elements rising from a curved band, with the suggestion of radiating
energy or kinetic motion (subtle lines or dots fanning outward from the tips).

The crown motif is rendered in antique gold (#C9A84C) while the wordmark is in
charcoal (#2B2B2B). The overall impression is: regal, modern, distinctly African,
and unmistakably luxurious.

The logo should work at sizes from 24px (favicon) to full billboard. Lines are
clean. No excessive detail that would collapse at small sizes.

Style reference: the refinement of Tom Ford branding, the cultural specificity
of Shea Moisture's visual identity (but more minimal), the modern luxury of
Byredo's logo system.
```

### 1B. Crown Emblem -- Icon Only (Favicon / App Icon)

```
The CrownKinetics crown emblem isolated as a standalone icon. The abstracted
African-inspired crown sits within a perfect circle or a rounded square
container shape.

The crown is rendered in antique gold (#C9A84C) on a charcoal (#2B2B2B)
background, OR in charcoal on a warm cream (#F5EDE0) background depending
on the application.

The icon version is further simplified from the primary logo: the kinetic
energy lines/dots around the crown tips may be removed for clarity at small
sizes. The essential read is: crown silhouette, geometric, African-inspired.

The circle or rounded-square container has a thin gold border or no border
at all. Clean, bold, instantly recognizable.

Sizes to generate: 16x16, 32x32, 180x180 (Apple touch icon), 512x512
(PWA icon), and 1024x1024 (master vector).

Style reference: the simplicity of Chanel's interlocking C's, the
cultural resonance of Adinkra symbols, the app-icon clarity of Glossier's
"G" icon.
```

## Section 2: Logo Variations

### 2A. Horizontal Layout (Header/Navigation Use)

```
CrownKinetics logo in a horizontal configuration: the crown emblem sits to
the left, and the full "CrownKinetics" wordmark extends to the right on a
single line. "Crown" and "Kinetics" may be treated as one word or visually
distinguished by weight (Crown in bold serif, Kinetics in light sans-serif).

Proportions: the emblem height equals the cap height of the wordmark. Total
aspect ratio approximately 4:1 to 5:1.

Versions:
- Gold emblem + Charcoal wordmark (for cream/light backgrounds)
- Gold emblem + Cream wordmark (for charcoal/dark backgrounds)
- All gold (for deep purple backgrounds)
- All charcoal (for light backgrounds, single-color applications)
```

### 2B. Vertical / Stacked Layout (Packaging / Print)

```
CrownKinetics logo in a vertical/stacked configuration: the crown emblem
is centered above the wordmark. "CROWN" on one line, "KINETICS" below it,
both centered.

The emblem is approximately 1.5x the width of the wordmark for visual
dominance. Generous spacing between the emblem and the text.

This is the primary packaging layout. It should feel monumental and
centered -- like a crest or family seal.

Same color versions as the horizontal layout.
```

### 2C. Reversed / Dark Mode Versions

```
All logo configurations rendered for dark backgrounds:

- Crown emblem in antique gold (#C9A84C), wordmark in warm cream (#F5EDE0),
  on charcoal (#2B2B2B) background.
- Crown emblem in antique gold, wordmark in warm cream, on deep purple
  (#3D1F47) background.
- Monochrome warm cream -- both emblem and wordmark in cream on dark.
- Monochrome gold -- both emblem and wordmark in gold on dark.

Ensure sufficient contrast ratio (minimum 4.5:1 for WCAG AA compliance)
in all combinations.
```

### 2D. Submark / Badge (Stamp, Watermark, Pattern Element)

```
A simplified badge version of the CrownKinetics identity: the crown emblem
enclosed within a circular border, with "CROWNKINETICS" set in letterspaced
sans-serif caps running along the inside of the circle (top arc) and
"EST. 2025" along the bottom arc.

This badge functions as a seal, stamp, or watermark. It can be embossed on
packaging, used as a pattern repeat element, or applied as a watermark on
photography.

Rendered in single-color: gold, charcoal, cream, or deep purple, depending
on application.

Style reference: heritage brand seals (Ralph Lauren, Diptyque), wax seal
aesthetics, passport stamps.

```

### 3B. Instagram Story (1080x1920)

```
A vertical story template optimized for 9:16 format.

LAYOUT STRUCTURE:
- Top 15%: "safe zone" with CrownKinetics crown emblem centered, small, at
  approximately 8% opacity as a watermark. This area accounts for the
  platform UI overlay.
- Upper-center (15-60%): large image/video placeholder area with generous
  bleed. Full-width, no borders.
- Lower-center (60-80%): text block area. Headline in large serif type,
  body text in sans-serif below it. Left-aligned with 60px left margin.
- Bottom 20%: CTA area. A rounded-rectangle button shape in antique gold
  with charcoal text ("Shop Now", "Learn More", "Swipe Up"). Below it,
  the @crownkinetics handle and crown emblem.

DESIGN ELEMENTS:
- A vertical gold accent line (2px) runs along the left edge from the text
  block down to the CTA, creating a visual throughline.
- Background: warm cream or charcoal with a subtle paper texture overlay
  at 5% opacity for tactile warmth.

ANIMATION NOTES (for motion templates):
- Crown emblem fades in at 0.5s
- Image slides up from bottom at 0.3s
- Text fades in line-by-line at 0.8s
- CTA button scales up with a gentle bounce at 1.2s

Style reference: Fenty Beauty stories, Pat McGrath Labs stories, premium
DTC brand story templates.
```

### 3C. Facebook Cover (1640x856)

```
A wide, panoramic composition optimized for Facebook's cover photo dimensions.

The layout is divided into atmospheric zones:
- LEFT 40%: The CrownKinetics vertical/stacked logo (crown emblem above
  wordmark) positioned in the left-center area. Rendered in antique gold
  and cream on a deep purple (#3D1F47) to charcoal (#2B2B2B) gradient
  background.
- RIGHT 60%: A lifestyle photography zone -- a warm, slightly blurred
  (gaussian blur at 3-5px) lifestyle image of natural hair is overlaid
  here. The image bleeds off the right edge. A warm cream overlay at 15%
  opacity ensures the image does not overpower the logo zone.
- The transition between left and right is a soft, organic gradient blend
  -- not a hard line.

Bottom-right corner: tagline "Your Crown. Your Chemistry." in small,
letterspaced sans-serif, cream color.

IMPORTANT: Account for the Facebook profile picture overlap in the
bottom-left. Keep that area free of critical content.

Style reference: luxury fragrance Facebook covers, fashion house social
banners.

## Section 6: Pattern & Texture Designs for Backgrounds

### 6A. Crown Repeat Pattern

```
A seamless, tileable pattern featuring the CrownKinetics crown emblem
repeated in a geometric grid. The crowns are arranged in alternating rows,
offset by 50% (brick-lay pattern).

Each crown is rendered as a minimal line drawing (1-2px stroke) in antique
gold (#C9A84C) on a charcoal (#2B2B2B) background, OR in charcoal on a
warm cream (#F5EDE0) background.

The crowns are spaced generously -- approximately 3x the crown width between
each repetition. The pattern should feel subtle and textural, not busy or
loud. At a distance it reads as a sophisticated texture; up close the crown
motif becomes visible.

Tile size: 200x200px for web backgrounds, 600x600px for print.

Use cases: website section backgrounds, email backgrounds, packaging tissue
paper, social media post backgrounds.
```

### 6B. Afrocentric Geometric Pattern

```
A seamless, tileable pattern inspired by West African textile traditions --
specifically referencing kente cloth geometry and Adinkra symbol aesthetics.

The pattern consists of interlocking triangles, chevrons, and concentric
circles arranged in horizontal bands. The motifs are abstracted and
modernized -- not a direct reproduction of any specific cultural pattern,
but clearly rooted in African geometric tradition.

Color palette: antique gold (#C9A84C) lines/shapes on a deep purple
(#3D1F47) background. Alternatively: charcoal shapes on warm cream.

Line weight: thin (1-2px for web, 0.5pt for print). The pattern is
elegant and restrained, not heavy or tribal-cliche.

Tile size: 400x400px for web, 1200x1200px for print.

Use cases: section dividers on the website, packaging accent bands,
collection page backgrounds, gift wrap.

IMPORTANT: This pattern must be designed with cultural sensitivity and
respect. Avoid random assemblages of "African-looking" shapes. Research
specific geometric traditions (Asante kente, Ndebele wall painting,
Berber textile geometry) and create something that is inspired by, not
appropriating, these traditions.

Style reference: Studio Museum Harlem gift shop packaging, Africa-themed
LOEWE collections, contemporary Afrocentric textile design.
```

### 6C. Organic Curl Texture Pattern

```
A seamless, tileable pattern that abstractly represents curl and coil
patterns. The design consists of interlocking spiral and S-curve shapes
of varying sizes, creating a dense but readable organic texture.

The curves reference the actual geometry of natural hair curl patterns:
loose waves, defined spirals, tight coils, and zig-zag kinks all
coexisting in a harmonious composition.

Rendered as thin line art (1.5px) in a single color. Color options:
- Antique gold on charcoal
- Charcoal on warm cream
- Deep purple on warm cream
- Warm cream on deep purple

The pattern should feel like looking at a beautiful coil pattern under
magnification -- scientific yet artistic, structural yet organic.

Tile size: 300x300px for web, 900x900px for print.

Use cases: website hero section overlays (at low opacity), product
label accent areas, shopping bag print, sticker designs.
```
