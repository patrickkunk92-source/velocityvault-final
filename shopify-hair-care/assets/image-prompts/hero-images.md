### Prompt (Primary -- Desktop 1920x800)

```
A stunning editorial portrait of a Black woman in her late 20s with a voluminous,
perfectly defined twist-out, shot from a slight low angle to convey power and grace.
She faces the camera at a relaxed three-quarter turn, chin slightly lifted, expression
serene and self-assured. Her skin is richly moisturized with a natural glow -- no
heavy retouching.

Hair is the focal point: large, springy coils catching warm golden light from a single
key light positioned at camera-left, creating soft highlights along the crown and a
gentle falloff across the mid-lengths. A subtle rim light from behind separates her
from the background.

Background: a smooth gradient from warm cream (#F5EDE0) at center to deep charcoal
(#2B2B2B) at the edges, slightly out of focus. Minimal, no props, no distractions.

She wears a simple, draped cream linen top that sits off one shoulder, exposing her
collarbone. A single delicate gold cuff bracelet on one wrist.

Color grading: warm midtones, lifted shadows with a slight brown/amber cast, muted
highlights leaning toward gold. No cool tones whatsoever. Overall mood is regal,
intimate, luxurious.

Aspect ratio 2.4:1. Shot on medium-format digital, 80mm equivalent, f/2.8, shallow
depth of field with tack-sharp focus on the eyes and front curls. Film grain: subtle.

Style reference: Solange Knowles editorial, Fenty Beauty campaign lighting, Byredo
fragrance advertising.

### 2A. Hair Type Collection -- "Know Your Curl" (1920x600)

```
A horizontal triptych-style composition featuring three Black women standing
side by side in a clean studio environment. Each woman represents a different
curl family:

LEFT: A woman with loose, flowing 3A/3B curls that cascade past her shoulders.
Hair has a glossy, well-moisturized sheen. She faces slightly right.

CENTER: A woman with thick, springy 3C/4A coils at shoulder length, voluminous
and defined. She faces directly forward with a warm, confident smile.

RIGHT: A woman with a glorious 4B/4C afro -- large, dense, and perfectly shaped
into a rounded silhouette. She faces slightly left.

All three women have similar warm-toned, minimal styling: nude/cream colored
simple tops. Their skin tones span a range -- deep mahogany, warm bronze,
rich umber -- celebrating the spectrum of Black beauty.

Lighting: broad, even, diffused studio light from a large overhead softbox,
supplemented by two strip lights on either side for gentle rim separation.
No harsh shadows. The look is bright, editorial, and clean.

Background: seamless warm cream (#F5EDE0) paper sweep. Floor fades into the
background with no visible horizon line.

Color grading: warm and natural. Skin tones are true-to-life with slight golden
warmth in the highlights. No desaturation.

Shot at 35mm equivalent, f/5.6 for even sharpness across all three subjects.
Aspect ratio 3.2:1.

Style reference: Glossier group campaign shots, Sephora editorial, Pattern Beauty
by Tracee Ellis Ross.
```

### 2B. Products Collection -- "The Ritual" (1920x600)

```
An overhead flat-lay arrangement of 6-8 premium hair care products (amber glass
bottles, matte charcoal jars, gold-capped tubes) arranged in a deliberate,
asymmetric grid on a surface of natural, unfinished travertine stone in warm beige.

Scattered intentionally around the products: a few dried botanicals (lavender
sprigs, rosemary, shea nuts still in shell), a small pool of golden oil on the
stone, a swatch of raw silk fabric in deep purple (#3D1F47) draped across one
corner, and a single gold hair pick with an Afro comb silhouette laying diagonally.

Lighting: natural window light from the upper-left, creating long, soft shadows
that extend toward the lower right. A white bounce card on the right fills the
shadows gently. Golden hour warmth.

Color palette is tightly controlled: creams, browns, golds, one accent of deep
purple. No blues, greens, or cool tones.

Shot directly overhead (bird's eye), 50mm equivalent, f/8 for broad depth of
field. Aspect ratio 3.2:1.

Style reference: Aesop product photography, Le Labo flat lays, Byredo editorial.
```

### 2C. Ingredients Collection -- "From the Earth" (1920x600)

```
A wide, cinematic landscape-format still life of raw, natural ingredients arranged
on a weathered dark wood surface. Ingredients include: a split coconut revealing
white flesh, a wooden bowl of raw shea butter (pale ivory, slightly textured),
scattered dried hibiscus flowers (deep crimson), a small glass bottle of golden
argan oil, whole coffee beans, a vanilla pod split open, and a sprig of fresh
rosemary.

Items are loosely scattered with organic spacing -- nothing feels rigid or
over-styled. A piece of cream-colored handmade paper peeks from under the
coconut. A thin dusting of turmeric powder creates a golden haze on one section
of the wood surface.

Lighting: moody and warm. A single directional light source from the left side,
mimicking late-afternoon sun through a window. Deep, warm shadows. Specular
highlights on the oil bottle and coconut flesh.

Color grading: rich, warm, slightly desaturated greens (rosemary), saturated
browns and golds. Deep shadows lean toward warm charcoal, never black.
Cinematic and sensory.

Aspect ratio 3.2:1. Shot at 35mm, f/4, with shallow focus on the center cluster
and gentle softness at the edges. Slight film grain.

campaigns, rustic luxury.

## 3. Seasonal Campaign Banners

### 3A. Summer Campaign -- "Sun-Sealed" (1920x700)

```
A Black woman outdoors in golden hour sunlight, laughing freely with her head
tilted back slightly. Her hair is styled in fresh, juicy two-strand twists that
fall to her mid-back, adorned with two or three small gold hair cuffs that catch
and reflect the sunlight.

Setting: an arid, sun-drenched landscape -- think desert mesa or sandy coastal
dunes. The background is soft and out of focus (f/2.0), rendered as abstract
warm tones of amber, sand, and pale sky.

She wears a flowing, earth-toned linen dress. Her skin glistens with a subtle
body oil sheen -- the golden hour light wraps around her shoulders and illuminates
the twists from behind (strong backlight).

Fill light from a reflector at camera-right keeps her face gently lit. Lens flare
is acceptable and desirable -- a small, warm flare element in the upper corner.

Color grading: hyper-warm. Push oranges and golds. Shadows lean toward a rich
brown-amber. Highlights are creamy, never blown. The overall image should feel
like summer warmth radiating from the screen.

Aspect ratio 2.75:1. Shot on 85mm, f/2.0. Slight overexposure in the background
for a dreamy feel.

Mood: joyful, free, radiant, sun-drenched.
Text overlay zone: right third of the frame.

Style reference: Fenty Skin summer campaigns, Dior J'adore outdoor editorials.
```

### 3B. Winter Campaign -- "The Restoration" (1920x700)

```
An intimate, close-up portrait of a Black man in his early 30s with a well-
groomed, moisturized beard and a short, tapered natural hairstyle (high-top
fade with defined coils on top). He is indoors, seated beside a window with
soft, diffused winter light filtering through sheer cream curtains.

He holds a dark amber glass jar of hair product (CrownKinetics branding
visible but subtle) in one hand near his jawline, as though he has just
finished applying it. His other hand rests on a plush, textured charcoal
throw blanket draped over the arm of a mid-century modern chair.

The interior setting is warm and minimal: a cream-colored wall, a brass
floor lamp slightly out of focus in the background emitting warm light,
and a small stack of hardcover books on a side table.

Expression: relaxed, contemplative, present. Eye contact with the camera
is direct but soft.

Lighting: cool window light as the key (from the right), balanced with the
warm practical lamp light (from the left-behind), creating a mixed-temperature
look that leans warm overall. Soft shadows under the jawline and cheekbones.

Color grading: muted warmth. Rich skin tones with amber undertones. The
charcoal and cream background elements are desaturated. The amber jar and
brass lamp are the warmest color accents.

Aspect ratio 2.75:1. Shot at 70mm, f/2.5, focused on the eyes and the
product jar.

Mood: calm, restorative, self-care, masculine luxury.
Text overlay zone: left third of the frame.

Style reference: Bevel grooming campaigns, Tom Ford editorial, Mr. Porter
lifestyle content.
```

### 3C. Spring Campaign -- "New Growth" (1920x700)

```
A wide environmental portrait of a young Black woman in her early 20s outdoors
in a lush botanical garden or greenhouse. She has a short, beautifully shaped
TWA (teeny weeny afro) that is about 2-3 inches long, freshly moisturized with
tight, glistening coils.

She stands among tall tropical plants -- monstera leaves, bird of paradise,
ferns -- with soft, dappled sunlight filtering through the foliage above,
creating organic shadow patterns on her skin and the ground.

She wears a simple cream-colored tank top. One hand reaches up to gently touch
her TWA with a look of quiet pride and self-love. A delicate gold necklace
with a small crown pendant rests at her collarbone.

Lighting: natural, dappled. The primary light comes from above and behind
(backlighting through the plants), creating a luminous halo effect around
her short afro. A natural bounce from the greenhouse floor provides fill.

Color grading: warm greens are permitted here as an exception to the brand
palette -- but they are muted and earthy, never neon or cool. The greens
lean toward olive and sage. Her skin and the gold jewelry remain the warmest
elements. Highlights push toward a creamy gold.

Aspect ratio 2.75:1. Shot at 50mm, f/2.8. Subject in the left third of the
frame with plants filling the right two-thirds.

Mood: renewal, tenderness, beginnings, natural beauty.
Text overlay zone: right third of the frame (over the softer plant background).

Style reference: Glossier outdoor campaigns, COS fashion editorial, botanical
garden fashion spreads.

## Art Direction Notes

1. **Diversity is non-negotiable.** Across all hero images, represent a range of skin tones, hair textures (3A through 4C), hair lengths, ages (20s through 50s), and gender expressions.
2. **Hair is always the hero.** Every composition should draw the eye to the hair first. Lighting, framing, and styling choices must serve this priority.
3. **No Eurocentric beauty standards.** Hair should never be manipulated to appear straighter, looser, or more "tamed" than it naturally is. Celebrate volume, shrinkage, density, and texture.
4. **Skin retouching philosophy.** Keep skin natural. Remove temporary blemishes if needed but preserve texture, pores, and natural skin variation. Moisturized glow is encouraged; airbrushed-plastic is not.
5. **Product placement is subtle.** When products appear in hero images, they are secondary to the human subject. The product should feel like a natural part of the scene, not a forced insertion.
6. **Text overlay safety.** Every hero image must have a designated "quiet zone" -- an area of low visual complexity where headline text can be placed with strong legibility. This zone should be specified in the prompt.
