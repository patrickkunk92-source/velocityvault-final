Curly and coily hair is naturally more vulnerable to heat damage because its structure makes it more porous, and heat can permanently alter your curl pattern if applied without proper protection. Our heat protectants form an invisible barrier that significantly reduces moisture loss and cuticle damage during heat styling.</p><p>Our lightweight heat protectant sprays and serums provide thermal protection up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit without weighing down your hair or leaving greasy residue. Infused with ingredients like argan oil, silk amino acids, and ceramides, they simultaneously protect and condition, leaving your blowout or press silky, shiny, and bouncy. For those who occasionally straighten their natural hair, our products help ensure that your curls bounce back after washing. We also carry thermal styling tools with adjustable temperature settings, because lower heat with the right product is always better than high heat with none. Protect the curl pattern you love, even when you choose to temporarily change it.</p>",
