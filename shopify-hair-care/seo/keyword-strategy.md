## 6. Competitor Keyword Gaps

Analysis of top competitors (Mielle Organics, SheaMoisture, Carol's Daughter, TGIN, Camille Rose, The Mane Choice) reveals keyword gaps CrownKinetics can exploit.

### Gap Category 1: Underserved Hair Types
Most competitors focus marketing on type 3 and 4C hair, leaving gaps in:
- **4A and 4B specific content** — Few brands create dedicated pages or content for these types
- **Mixed-texture hair care** — Content for people with multiple curl patterns on one head
- **Men's textured hair care** — Severely underserved by major brands in organic search
- **Children's natural hair care** — Limited specialized product content from competitors

**Recommended Action:** Create dedicated collection pages and blog content for 4A, 4B, men's, and children's hair care to capture uncontested search traffic.

### Gap Category 2: Education-First Content
Competitors lean transactional. CrownKinetics can own informational search intent:
- **Ingredient education** — "What does glycerin do for natural hair," "is mineral oil bad for natural hair"
- **Science of hair** — "Hair porosity explained," "protein moisture balance science"
- **Cultural content** — "History of black hair care," "natural hair movement timeline"
- **Routine building** — "How to build a natural hair routine from scratch"

**Recommended Action:** Develop a content hub / learning center with comprehensive guides that rank for informational queries and funnel users to product pages.

### Gap Category 3: Problem-Solution Content
Competitors underinvest in content addressing specific frustrations:
- **Product failures** — "Why does my edge control flake," "deep conditioner didn't work"
- **Transition struggles** — "Awkward stage of transitioning hair," "how to manage two textures"
- **Technique troubleshooting** — "Why does my twist out frizz," "wash and go won't clump"

**Recommended Action:** Create "troubleshooting" blog content that addresses real frustrations, positions CrownKinetics products as solutions, and captures frustrated-customer search traffic.

### Gap Category 4: Local and Community Keywords
- "Black owned hair care brands"
- "Natural hair products made in [city/state]"
- "Loc salon recommendations near me" (blog content, not direct ranking)
- "Natural hair events 2026"

**Recommended Action:** Create a "Black-Owned" brand story page optimized for these terms. Publish community event roundup content.

### Gap Category 5: Comparison and "vs" Keywords
- "SheaMoisture vs Mielle Organics"
- "Jamaican black castor oil vs regular castor oil"
- "LOC method vs LCO method for low porosity hair"
- "Gel vs cream for wash and go"
- "Satin bonnet vs silk pillowcase"

**Recommended Action:** Create comparison blog posts that capture high-intent commercial investigation traffic and position CrownKinetics as the knowledgeable authority.

## 10. Notes on Keyword Implementation

1. **Avoid keyword stuffing.** Each page should target one primary keyword and 3-5 semantically related secondary keywords naturally woven into content.
2. **Use exact-match keywords in:** Page titles, H1 tags, meta descriptions, first 100 words of body content, image alt text, and URL slugs.
3. **Use semantic variations in:** H2/H3 subheadings, body paragraphs, product descriptions, and internal anchor text.
4. **Monitor cannibalization.** Ensure no two pages compete for the same primary keyword. Use the keyword mapping above as the single source of truth.
5. **Update quarterly.** Revisit search volumes, competition levels, and ranking performance every quarter to adjust strategy.
