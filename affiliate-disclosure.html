                    <strong>🔍 Transparency First:</strong> VelocityVault is an affiliate marketing platform. We earn commissions when you purchase bikes through our links. This disclosure explains exactly how our affiliate relationships work.
                </div>

                <h2>Our Affiliate Relationships</h2>
                <p>
                    VelocityVault operates as an affiliate platform that helps you discover and purchase premium BMX bikes from trusted retailers, primarily through Amazon Associates program and direct brand affiliate partnerships. When you click a product link and make a purchase, VelocityVault earns a commission.
                </p>

                <h3>Primary Affiliate Partners</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Amazon Associates:</strong> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</li>
                    <li><strong>Direct Brand Partnerships:</strong> We have direct affiliate agreements with manufacturers including SE Bikes, Mongoose, Schwinn, Haro, Cult, Crew, GT Bikes, Elite, RoyalBaby and others.</li>
                    <li><strong>Third-Party Networks:</strong> We use affiliate networks like ShareASale, Rakuten, and Impact for additional brand partnerships.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Commission Structure</h2>
                <div class="section">
                    <h4>How We Earn</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Amazon Sales:</strong> 3-6% commission on qualifying purchases (varies by category)</li>
                        <li><strong>Direct Brand Partnerships:</strong> 5-10% commission depending on brand agreement</li>
                        <li><strong>Affiliate Networks:</strong> 5-15% commission varies by program</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>What You Pay</h4>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Your price is identical</strong> whether you buy directly from retailers or through VelocityVault links. The affiliate commission comes from the retailer's marketing budget, not from you. You don't pay extra.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Member Cashback</h4>
                    <p>
                        VelocityVault members earn 5-7% cashback by shopping through our platform. This means we share part of our affiliate commission with you:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We earn 5% from Amazon on a $300 bike purchase = $15 commission</li>
                        <li>We share 5% with you = $15 cashback to your account</li>
                        <li>Our revenue comes from premium features, sponsorships, and higher affiliate tiers</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>Referral Program Commissions</h2>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                        VelocityVault referral program participants earn 10-20% commission on purchases made by their referred members. These commissions come directly from:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Our affiliate margins (we take 10% of the affiliate commission)</li>
                        <li>Premium membership revenue</li>
                        <li>B2B partnerships and sponsorships</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Important:</strong> Referral commissions do NOT come from the referred user's purchase price. Members paying customers get the same price as everyone else, and also receive 5-7% cashback.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>FTC Compliance</h2>
                <div class="section">
                    <h4>Federal Trade Commission Guidelines</h4>
                    <p>
                        VelocityVault complies with the Federal Trade Commission's "Endorsement and Testimonial Guides" which require clear disclosure of material connections (like affiliate relationships) between endorsers and products/services.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Every product link is clearly marked as an affiliate link when applicable</li>
                        <li>We disclose our affiliate status in navigation and footers</li>
                        <li>Blog posts and reviews clearly state when commissions are earned</li>
                        <li>We never misrepresent commission rates or relationships</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>State Laws</h4>
                    <p>
                        We comply with affiliate disclosure laws in all jurisdictions, including California Consumer Legal Remedies Act, New York laws, and equivalent state statutes.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>Our Independence</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Important:</strong> While VelocityVault earns commissions on affiliate sales, this does NOT influence our product recommendations or reviews. We follow these principles:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Honest Reviews:</strong> We provide honest opinions on bikes including pros, cons, and comparisons</li>
                    <li><strong>No Payola:</strong> Brands cannot pay us for positive reviews or higher rankings</li>
                    <li><strong>Price Comparisons:</strong> We help you find the best price across retailers</li>
                    <li><strong>Unbiased Recommendations:</strong> We recommend the best bikes for YOUR needs, not our commission rates</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparency on Conflicts:</strong> We clearly disclose when we have affiliate relationships</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Income Disclaimer</h2>
                <div class="section">
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">
                        ⚠️ IMPORTANT - EARNINGS DISCLAIMER
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        VelocityVault's affiliate program and referral earnings are variable. Average earnings for referral program members are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Passive Members:</strong> $0-50/month (average)</li>
                        <li><strong>Active Sharers:</strong> $100-500/month</li>
                        <li><strong>Influencers/Content Creators:</strong> $500-5000+/month</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Results vary dramatically</strong> based on your audience size, engagement, content quality, and marketing effort. Past performance (or other members' earnings) do not guarantee future results. Most referral program members earn little to nothing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        VelocityVault makes no guarantee of earnings. Success in affiliate marketing requires significant effort, audience building, and marketing expertise.
